## Themes

 - Processing / management of large datasets from 
   sensors
 - Visualization of complex datasets  
 - Getting from data to understanding for managers
   



# Drifters


## Low cost

 - unit cost < $250
 - Outreach opportunity for schools etc.
 - Affordable for small communities 


## Visualization

 - Observe complex patterns
 - Select representative parts of data
 - View relationships between drifters


## Internet of things

 - AES encrypted transmission
 - stream network monitoring


## Application

 - Shallow environments, rivers
 - Detect tributary specific inputs
   - warm water from **that** outfall
   - road salt from **that** stream



# SNNM


## Simple == Open

 - Try to avoid calibration
 - Prefer direct use of real world observations
 - Minimize complexity
